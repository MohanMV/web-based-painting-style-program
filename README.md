# Web-Based Painting Style Program

Coursework from the University of Hertfordshire

## Overview

I designed and developed an interactive painting program based off a given template using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web-based program has five main features, such as selecting eight different pre-set colours, a custom colour blend tool, an eraser, four different pre-set brush sizes, and a clear option.
